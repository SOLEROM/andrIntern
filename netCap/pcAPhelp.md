For all phones, wi-fi only: Set up your PC as a wireless access point, then run wireshark on the PC

Similarly to making your PC a wireless access point, but can be much easier, is using reverse tethering. If you happen to have an HTC phone they have a nice reverse-tethering option called "Internet pass-through", under the network/mobile network sharing settings. It routes all your traffic through your PC and you can just run Wireshark there.
